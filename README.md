WOW this gave my brain a super workout! I really enjoyed it although a few parts where frustrating.

Getting the buttons to show the number of upgrades purchased was difficult and although it works i think it is a work around rather than how it 'should' be done. I played around with .innerHTML, .innerText and .textContent but textContent seemed to work best.

Creating callback functions makes a lot more sense now i've used them in urnest.

I originally had the local storage as seperate key value pairs but i found that it was easier to just have a single array and using JSON stringify and parse to convert it to a string, although this took a lot of time to get right. Using seperate key value pairs made the JavaScript harder to understand and work on.
